Deep Learning-Based Disease Detection: Psoriasis, Acne, and Eczema-Using VGG16,VGG19,ResNet50

This project focuses on deep learning-based skin disease detection, specifically targeting Psoriasis, Acne, and Eczema. We implemented and compared three popular convolutional neural network architectures—VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50—for image classification. The dataset used was preprocessed and augmented to improve model generalization and performance. Each model was trained and evaluated based on accuracy, loss, and validation metrics. The results highlight the effectiveness of deep learning in automating dermatological diagnosis.

Among the three models, ResNet50 demonstrated the highest accuracy, making it the most effective choice in our experiments. However, both VGG16 and VGG19 also showed strong performance and may be preferred in scenarios requiring lighter architectures or faster training. Model selection can therefore be tailored based on application constraints like computational resources or real-time deployment needs. This comparison emphasizes that while deeper models offer better accuracy, simpler models still hold significant value. Our work showcases how multiple architectures can be leveraged depending on practical use cases.
