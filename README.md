Deep Learning-Based Disease Detection: Psoriasis, Acne, and Eczema-Using VGG16,VGG19,ResNet50

Skin diseases such as Psoriasis, Acne, and Eczema are common across all age groups and can
significantly affect a person’s quality of life. Accurate and early diagnosis of these diseases is crucial for
effective treatment and management. However, diagnosis by dermatologists often relies on manual
inspection, which can be subjective and time-consuming, especially in rural or underserved areas with
limited access to specialists.
Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) offer a promising
solution to automate the diagnosis process. Deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated excellent performance in image recognition tasks. In the
healthcare domain, CNNs have shown promising results in analyzing medical images, including skin
lesion classification.
Our project aims to develop a deep learning-based system that can automatically detect and classify
three common skin diseases—Psoriasis, Acne, and Eczema—using image data. This automated tool can
assist dermatologists in decision-making and provide a fast and accessible method for preliminary
disease detection.
